description: PAW32xx ultra low power wireless mouse chip

compatible: "pixart,paw3222"

include: spi-device.yaml

properties:
  irq-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description:
      GPIO connected to the motion pin, active low.

  power-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description:
      GPIO connected to the power control pin.

  res-cpi:
    type: int
    description: |
      CPI resolution for the sensor. This can also be changed in runtime using
      the paw32xx_set_resolution() API.

  force-awake:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Initialize the sensor in "force awake" mode. This can also be enabled or
      disabled in runtime by the application using the paw32xx_force_awake()
      API.

  scroll-layers:
    type: array
    description: |
      List of layer numbers where the sensor should operate in scroll mode.
      When any of these layers are active, the sensor will report scroll
      wheel events instead of mouse movement.

  snipe-layers:
    type: array
    description: |
      List of layer numbers where the sensor should operate in snipe mode.
      When any of these layers are active, the sensor will use reduced
      sensitivity for precise movement.

  snipe-cpi:
    type: int
    description: |
      CPI resolution for snipe mode. Lower values provide more precise movement.

  cpi-dividor:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Movement divider for normal mode. Higher values reduce sensitivity.

  snipe-cpi-dividor:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Movement divider for snipe mode. Higher values reduce sensitivity.

  scroll-tick:
    type: int
    default: 20
    description: |
      Movement threshold for generating scroll events. Higher values require
      more movement to trigger a scroll event.

  automouse-layer:
    type: int
    description: |
      Layer number to automatically activate when mouse movement is detected.
      Set to 0 to disable automouse functionality.

  automouse-timeout-ms:
    type: int
    default: 600
    description: |
      Timeout in milliseconds for deactivating the automouse layer after
      the last mouse movement.
